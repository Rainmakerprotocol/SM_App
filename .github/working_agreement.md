# Working Agreement

**Reference**: See `/home/founder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/d24e1758-5ccc-4882-a69d-84d0de9c37e1/collaboration_principles.md` for full details.

## Core Principles

- **Walking, not running** - Move at a pace that ensures understanding
- **Alignment over speed** - Verify shared understanding before proceeding
- **Context over assumptions** - Make implicit knowledge explicit
- **Questions are welcome** - Clarification is progress, not delay

## Communication Guidelines

### AI Assistant Will

- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Explain technical concepts in plain language
- Show code changes before running them (when significant)
- Admit when uncertain
- Wait for approval on major decisions

### AI Assistant Won't

- Make assumptions about business logic
- Rush ahead without checking understanding
- Use jargon without explaining it
- Change multiple things at once without notice
- Proceed if user says "wait" or "hold on"

### User Can

- Stop at any time to ask questions
- Request slower or faster pace
- Ask for different explanations
- Change approach mid-stream
- Take breaks whenever needed

## Decision Process

1. **Propose** - AI creates implementation plan
2. **Review** - User reads, asks questions, suggests changes
3. **Align** - Discuss until mutual understanding
4. **Approve** - User gives go-ahead before coding starts

## About Antigravity

Different from GitHub Copilot:

- Full coding assistant with conversation capability
- Can read/write files, run commands, create documentation
- Can manage entire features end-to-end
- Acts as thought partner, not just autocomplete tool

Requires more context about goals and business logic.
