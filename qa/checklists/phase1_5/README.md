# Phase 1-5 Checklist Library

Add scenario-based Markdown checklists for regression, performance, beta simulation, and automation sign-off.

Suggested filenames:
- `regression.md`
- `performance.md`
- `beta_simulation.md`

Each checklist should include:
- Test steps
- Expected result
- Pass/Fail column
- Evidence link (path into `qa/artifacts/`).
